## **Installing**

Installing JourneyMap on the server for Forge or Fabric adds some optional utility for server admins. Note: Forge or Fabric versions can connect to JourneyMap on the server no matter if it is Forge or Fabric.

## **Textual Guide**

1. Put the JourneyMap.jar in your **server mods** folder: ```(server folder)/mods```
2. The first time you start the server after installing JourneyMap, a new config file will be generated in ```(server folder)/journeymap/server/<version>/journeymap.server.minecraft~<world>.config```
3. Clients that are connected will be automatically connected to the worldid. This results in the creation of a new folder by the client to store waypoints and map images: ```.minecraft/journeymap/data/mp/(server_worldid)```
