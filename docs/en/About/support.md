# **Live Help on Discord**

**Support is available on the public [JourneyMap Discord server](https://discord.gg/eP8gE69)**

- Be sure to report the version of Minecraft, JourneyMap, and the Fabric, Quilt, Forge or NeoForge version you're using when you ask a question.
- If you aren't answered right away, **be patient and stay connected**. Discord often is paced more like a forum than a chat room. Even though people are connected, they may actually be away from their computer when you join.
