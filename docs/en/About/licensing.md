# **Licensing**

JourneyMap is distributed under an All Rights Reserved license. This means that you may not alter, host or distribute JourneyMap yourself.

## **What you CAN do**

- Create a modpack containing JourneyMap, as long as JourneyMap is downloaded from CurseForge or Modrinth as part of the modpack installation or launch process. This includes modpacks hosted directly on CurseForge or Modrinth.

- If you’re using solder.io with Technic to allow each user to download the mod directly from CurseForge, you may also include JourneyMap. Just ensure that you’re [following these directions](https://github.com/bochen415/JourneyMap-TechnicSolder-Tutorial/wiki/JourneyMap-TechnicSolder-Tutorial).

- Interact and make use of our open-source projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamJM/) under the terms of the individual licenses of those projects.

- Decompile the mod for the purpose of inspecting how it works and what it does, under the relevant laws in the USA.

- Work with our mod contrary to this license **when given explicit written permission to do so by techbrew**.

## **What you CANNOT do**

- Modify the mod in any way, even for personal use.

- Re-host, redistribute or bundle the mod in any way, including as part of a larger distribution such as a modpack. This includes Technic modpacks, which bundle all of the mods into a single zip file.

If you’re unhappy with the way Technic handles this, please feel free to drop a comment on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/TechnicPack/TechnicSolder/issues/424).

- Decompile our mod or extract the contents of the JAR and make use of the code or assets therein for any purpose.

- Extract code or assets from our otherwise open-source projects from the mod JAR and make use of them. The JAR itself is distributed under an All Rights Reserved license. If you want to work with our open-source projects, please find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/TeamJM/) instead.
