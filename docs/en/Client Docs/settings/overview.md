## **Settings**

JourneyMap provides more than a few configuration options, allowing you to customize the behaviour and appearance of many different aspects of the mod. All of these settings are made available through the settings manager.

To get to the settings manager, open the full-screen map and click the settings button at the bottom, or press the ++o++ key. Each entry in the list represents a specific category of settings - click on it to expand and see the settings within.

!!! note "Note"

    Each category has a Reset button. Please note that pressing this button will reset the settings in that category to the default settings bundled with JourneyMap, instead of simply discarding your changes.
