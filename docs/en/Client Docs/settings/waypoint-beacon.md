## **Waypoint Beacon Settings**

By default, waypoints are displayed in the world using a beacon beam in the distance, which allows you to see where they
are from anywhere in the world. By default, you can look towards the beam and see the waypointâ€™s icon and label as well.
This behaviour can be customized below.
