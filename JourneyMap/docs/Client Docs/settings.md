## **Settings**

JourneyMap provides more than a few configuration options, allowing you to customize the behaviour and appearance of many different aspects of the mod. All of these settings are made available through the settings manager.

![Overview](/img/settings/overview.png){ align=left }

To get to the settings manager, open the [full-screen map](full-screen-map.md) and click the settings button at the bottom, or press the O key. Each entry in the list represents a specific category of settings - click on it to expand and see the settings within.

!!! note "Note"

    Each category has a Reset button. Please note that pressing this button will reset the settings in that category to the default settings bundled with JourneyMap, instead of simply discarding your changes.

Some of these categories have quite a few settings. Feel free to skip to a specific category by clicking on the links on the right side.

## **Grid Settings**

Both minimap presets and the full-screen map may have a configurable grid overlay. You can customize this overlay by clicking on the Edit Grid… button below the settings in each respective category.

You can also reach this from the [full-screen](full-screen-map.md) map by holding the Shift key and clicking on the grid button at the top.

The grid outlines individual chunks on the map. Grid styles that include region lines will draw an extra grid with differently-coloured lines to outline world regions on the map.

- Select a colour for the grid lines by clicking on the colour wheel.
- Select the map type (day, night or caves) to edit on the left side.
- Click the **Reset** button to reset the current map type to the default grid settings.
- Click the **Cancel** button to discard your changes and close the grid editor.
- Click the **Save** button to save your changes and close the grid editor.

| Setting | Options | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Style | **Squares**, SquaresWithRegion, GridRegion, Dots, Checkers | Change the type of grid overlaid on the map |
| Opacity | Percentage: (default: **50**) | How opaque the grid should be drawn |

## **Minimap Settings**

JourneyMap allows you to have two minimap presets. Each preset represents a separate set of settings - essentially allowing you to have two distinct minimaps available to switch between.

!!! note "Note"

    The settings for each minimap are identical, so we’ll only cover a single preset below.

To switch between minimap presets, press the switch minimap preset key (the # key by default).
